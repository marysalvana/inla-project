# Fast statistical inference for climate projections with INLA

This is a collection of small research reports I produced during a 3 month project funded by [the ReCoVER network](http://www.recoverlwec.org).


# Projects

- [**INLA from scratch**](inla-from-scratch): In this project I am implementing INLA for Bayesian inference in a simple model without using the R-package.

- [**Global mean surface temperatures**](global-temperature): I have used R-INLA to predict future global mean temperature from an ensemble of climate model runs and historical temperature observations.

- [**Storm track density analysis**](): *Coming soon*
