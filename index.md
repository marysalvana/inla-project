# Fast statistical inference for climate projections with INLA

This is a collection of small research reports I produced during a 3 month project funded by [the ReCoVER network](http://www.recoverlwec.org).


## Projects

- [**INLA from scratch**](inla-from-scratch): In this project I am implementing the INLA methodology for Bayesian inference from scratch, i.e. without using the R-package.

- [**Global mean surface temperatures**](global-temperature): I have used R-INLA to predict future global mean temperature from an ensemble of climate model runs and historical temperature observations.

- [**Storm track density analysis**](storm-tracks): *work in progress*

- [**Linear regression on a spatial grid**](grid-regression): I show how a Laplace approximation can be used to fit linear regression models over a spatial grid, under the assumption that the fields of regression parameters are realisations of smooth spatial processes.


## Misc

- [**Problematic correlation of posterior predictive samples**](sampler-problem)
